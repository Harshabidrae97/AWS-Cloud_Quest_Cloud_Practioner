1 - AWS Calculator:

    AWS Pricing Calculator is an easy way to estimate your cloud costs.
    
    Before creating an estimate, consider creating a logical grouping of your services.
    A useful logical grouping could be Web Servers.
    
    Adding multiple groups to an estimate gives you more insight into your data.
    
    You can see the breakdown of your services under the Organization tab.
    
    Each card allows you to configure details about your service, and also get direct links to the product pages.
    
    Different regions may have different prices. In the event that a customer has spiky traffic
    throughout the day you should use Advanced estimate. Quick estimate assumes consistent utilization.
    
    The cyclical nature of service usage is common. For example, usage may be heavy during
    business hours. You want to be sure you can model those peak periods.
    
    The Baseline usage refers to the minimum amount of servers during non-peak time.
    Conversely, peak usage represents the amount of servers required at peak periods.
    
    When creating estimates, users often do one-to-one mappings of their on-premise hardware
    to the cloud. For example, don't assume 4GB is necessary because that is used on-premise.
    One-to-one mapping of hardware specifications often prevents users from effectively making
    use of all cloud benefits. Its important to right-size your instances.
    
    For new cloud customers, it is often recommended to use On-Demand Instances.
    Once a customer has established enough usgae data and are certain of their
    commitment, they canacquire significant savings in the future vy using other plans.
    
    Amazon instance pricing is very granular, offering per-second biling for many instances.
    
    Amazon Elastic Block Storage offers various storage types based on your workloads.
    For basic web servers, General Purpose SSDs might suffice. However, for more
    specialized workloads involving large data transfer or high input-output
    operations, other storage types might be appropriate.
    
    Part of AWS pricing includes Data Transfer rates. All data coming into AWS from the internet is free,
    however there may be charges for innter-region and outbound data. If you're unsure about how much
    data you use, there are tools to help you measure this on yout current systems.
    
    From time to time, AWS lowers the prices of their services. These cost savings are automatically 
    applied to the customer.
    
    Your cost estimation link persits. If you need to share your estimates with other people,
    just send them your link.
